# Deep_Learning_Skills

Deep Learning - Subset of Machine Learning; Based on Multi-Layered Neural Networks; We have both Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques

**Main Taks which we created: To Mimic Human Brain (We want Machines to think Like Human)**

**Frameworks: Tensorflow**

**Types:**

**1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Solves both Classification and Regression

**2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Solves better with Image and Video Frames

RCNN, Masked RCNN helps to do Object Detection, along with Image Segmentation

**3. Recurrent Neural Network:** Works well for NLP, Time Series (Time Series like Forecasting Sales)

Better for which involves Sequence of Data

We will learn about:

**(i) Word Embedding**

**(ii) LSTM RNN**

**(iii) GRU RNN**

**(iv) Bidirectional LSTM RNN**

**(v) Encoder Decoder**

**(vi) Transformers**

**(vii) BERT**
